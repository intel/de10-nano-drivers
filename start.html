	<h1>Welcome to the Terasic DE10-Nano* kit!</h1>

	<p>To help you on your FPGA developing journey, we created a web site (served up by the board) that contains a lot of great resources for you to learn about the board and get you developing code quickly.<br>
	<br> 
	Here's what you can do on the site:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Start:</strong> Explore features of the board</li>
		<li><strong>Play:</strong> Interact with the hardware</li>
		<li><strong>Learn:</strong> Learn about SoC FPGA software flow</li>
		<li><strong>Develop:</strong> Install tools needed for development using Intel®&nbsp;SoC&nbsp;FPGA devices</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Sounds exciting? Then let's get you connected to the board! But first, Windows® PC users need to install a driver to enable Ethernet over USB.</p>
	<h2>Enable Ethernet Over USB</h2>

	<p>Follow these steps to enable Ethernet over USB:</p>

		<li>Open device manager. If you see a warning symbol next to "RNDIS" under "Other Device", right-click to select it, and choose "Update Driver Software".</li>
	        <img alt="RNDIS Warning" height="" src="Docs/RNDIS_warning.png" width="">
		<li value="2">Select “Browse my computer for the driver software”.</li>
		<li value="3">Browse to the DE10-Nano SD Card &gt; Drivers &gt; Windows and select "RNDIS".</li>
                <img alt="Browse to RNDIS" height="" src="Docs/Browse_to_RNDIS.png" width="">
		<li value="4">Click OK.</li>
		<li value="5">Open a web browser. We recommend using Google Chrome* or Mozilla Firefox*.</li>
		<li value="6">Type <b>192.168.7.1</b> into the URL pane to connect to the web site served by the board.</li><br>
	</ol>
	<p>Once your connected, navigate to the start, play, learn and develop pages.</p>
	<p>When you’re ready, go back to the <strong>Develop</strong> page and click the on-line survey link to tell us what you think; your feedback will help make the next release even better.<br>
	<br>
	We hope your experience with the DE10-Nano board is informative and fun!</p>

	<p>Happy developing!</p>
